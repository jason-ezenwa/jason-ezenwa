# Hi there! üëã

I'm Chukwuemelie Jason Obumse, a software engineer interested in full stack development. Thanks for stopping by my Github page! üöÄ

# About Me

I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with two years of experience in software development, specialized in backend development and frontend development, experienced in DevOps and database management.

I am adept at crafting clean and testable code, to develop and seamlessly integrate secure RESTful and GraphQL API paradigms, with frontend mobile and web applications. I am also skilled in integrating data analytics tools to support informed business decisions.

I have a track record of architecting, developing and deploying highly efficient software, enhancing data visualization, and elevating online visibility through effective SEO. I have successfully delivered high-quality software solutions utilized by thousands of individuals across the blue collar, fintech, lifestyle and transportation industries while working at LaborHack, Wynk Nigeria and TruckDispatch.

FYI, I am currently working on [Zen](https://github.com/jason-ezenwa/zen-api), you can have a look ;)

When I'm not coding, you can find me watching football matches, playing video games, watching anime & TV shows, or reading comic books. I love exploring new things and learning new skills.
